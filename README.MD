This project (with a temporal name, I guess) aims to recreate an engine like the one present on Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal inside Unity.

This project is developed with the solely purpose of learning and having fun while re-creating something we love. 

We aim to develop the engine with an approximate look and feel to it like the original games have. However it does not aim to be precise and one of the main focal point is to do things our way, without copying anything but aesthetics and feeling. 

The previous statement means it's all made "as we feel it's interesting", so for example there's big differences with the original engine:

* This is not tile based. Sprites move and are placed independently
* Alignment to pixel is done in a soft way. There's no pixel-wise movement, as we use the regular Unity Transform component
* Collisions are made manually for each map placing Collider components.
* We use unity's animation system and UI, instead on developing our own

And a long etcetera that we'll be realizing along the way of developing it.
